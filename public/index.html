                My hobbies include coding, playing violin, and basketball. I swam for both a club team and my school team throughout high school,
                and was also a part of the school orchestra, where I was seated second chair for the last two years. I have recently become more 
                serious regarding computer science due to a combination of both renewed excitement regarding the field and the start of college</h3>
